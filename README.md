### Code School Q&A

#### By Carmen Kolodziej

## ðŸ˜¸ Description

Hi Friends! Although your journey into tech may seem like a dumpster fire at times, this dumpster fire will give you light and keep you warm. Please join me in building the official Code School Q&A web app. My goal is to have our friends, students, and folks that may not have a chance to ask a question during the stream be able to submit questions that we could try our best to answer during the stream. At the moment, I have a Firebase database set up to store questions submitted. Check out the [Ideas section](#ideas) section to see what ideas I have thought about implementing to the page.

I am open to any ideas for this app! This is an open source project for anyone in their journey in coding. Please feel free to create an issue and let me know how I can improve the documentation.

I started this project when I was learning NextJS and Sass. So far, there is a main page that has a small explanation, a form to submit a question, a modal that pops up that your question was sent, and a list of questions displayed below the form. It is fully functioning! The question is sent to a firebase database and the questions are fetched from same database. Currently styling is an experiment I had with Sass ðŸ˜…. Please feel free to get creative and submit a PR with your design!

If you are unfamiliar with either NextJS or Sass, there is fantastic documentation to help you get going. Youtube and Udemy have also been great resources for learning.

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
  - Note: Feel free to write regular CSS in the Sass files, that is the awesome part I have learned about Sass!

Again, I am open to suggestions and open to learn with you. If you find that there is a better library or technology that could help improve the project, feel free to create an issue and let's taco bout it ðŸŒ®

- The front-end is using create-next-app
- Sass for styling
- Google Firebase for back-end
